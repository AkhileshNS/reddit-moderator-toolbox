Before you fuck around with pushing shit, read this first.
========================

- This repo is for team development for the redesign.
- Experimenting aka fucking around with the redesign is to be done in your own private repo. 
- Contributing here means that you are on IRC and discussed the things you are working on so we are on the same page. 
- What that same page entails is roughly outlined [here in this project](https://github.com/creesch/reddit-moderator-toolbox/projects/2)


New front-end api
====================
The dev admins have worked with us to implement a front-end event based api which we can use to hook toolbox into reddit. Details about that can be found in /r/tb_dev **those are drafts, not working documents**. We are not fucking around with hacky solutions for implementation until we have access to the frontend api. The only place were we "use" it now is in devtools.js to give us an idea of what elements currently are getting their information broadcasted. 

If you contribute you are on IRC.
====================

Yes, that already has been said but just to make shit absolutely clear. If we do not work together on this properly it will turn into a unholy mess of spagetti code. 

Read up on our development guidelines. 
====================

They have been updated since most of you contributed to toolbox.
