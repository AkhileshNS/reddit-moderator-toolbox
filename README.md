Before you fuck around with pushing shit, read this first.
========================

- This repo is for team development for the redesign.
- Experimenting aka fucking around with the redesign is to be done in your own private repo. 
- Contributing here means that you are on IRC and discussed the things you are working on so we are on the same page. 
- What that same page entails is roughly outlined [here in this project](https://github.com/creesch/reddit-moderator-toolbox/projects/2)

Documenting our shit
====================
We have been lazy in that regard. Use jsdoc to document new functions and old functions you rework, [jsdoc comments get rendered on build](http://www.creesch.com/tb/docs/) and will help future contributors make sense of the maze that is tbutils, tbui, etc. Comment smartly, explain code decisions specifically where it might not immediatly apparanty *why* code looks like it does. 


New front-end api
====================
The dev admins have worked with us to implement a front-end event based api which we can use to hook toolbox into reddit. This is not finished yet, be aware of that.

If you contribute you are on IRC.
====================

Yes, that already has been said but just to make shit absolutely clear. If we do not work together on this properly it will turn into a unholy mess of spagetti code. 

Read up on our development guidelines. 
====================

They have been updated since most of you contributed to toolbox.
